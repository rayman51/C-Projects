# C-Projects
My name is Ray Mannion and I am a 3rd student at the 
Galway/Mayo Institute of Technology studying 
Software Development

In this repository you will find 2 project I was asked to complete  
during second year.

The first project was to create a bingo game. The game would randomly generate bingo cards and allow you to play a game. 

The second project was to create a program to allow a user to enter rugby statistic and save to file using a linked list.
The user can enter new players and details, update existing players and delete players from the list. 

In the folder there is another readMe file showing you how to run the program and also a small user manaual.
